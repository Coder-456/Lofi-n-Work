## Productivity

Lo-fi beats boast the calming and therapeutic effects beneficial to studying. By reducing stress and anxiety-producing cortisol levels, students can focus on their studies without diversion of their attention. Listening to lofi beats on other mediums such as spotify or youtube can cause distraction. To leverage the purpose of eliminating distraction, there are 4 lofi beats 'After Rain', 'Soft Light', 'Wind Over', 'That's Cool' included as .mp3 files. Only play and stop buttons are included in the player to maintain minimalism. 

Many times an idea flashes in our mind or even a task that we need to accomplish. When not writtern down, you are most probably going to forget it. During focused session of study or coding or work, these ideas and tasks has to be noted down to accomplish later. The extension allows you to manage and organize tasks in the form of simple list. Once a task is added, it takes an entry in the list and clicking on any of the list item will delete the item. Once again, Minimalistic. 

It is simple and easy to use. 

Study focused and Be Productive !!
